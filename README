1. First thing is to make package.json file.  This will tell npm what packages to install for your application.

2. '$ npm install' will install the dependencies.

3. Make a server.js file (this is the file that will be run with '$ node server.js') and add the 3 required calls to bring in express, http, and socket.io.

4. Add a listener (for connections to index) to send back an index.html file.

4.1 Don't forget to call http.listen(port, func) at the bottom to actually run your server.

5. Create your index.html

5.1. If your index.html requires some javascript (as it probably will) then make sure you add a listener to server.js that will sendFile('index.js')

6. Now that you have server code and client code, try running everything to make sure it all works!

7. Don't forget to git
